> A React Calculator Application for Math Magicians Inc.

It has 3 pages, a Home, Calculate and Quote page. The navigation is linked using react-router-dom. The calculator app is mounted as a component on the Calculate page.

Logic is written to provide for calculations breaking the Calculator app into the components Display, ButtonPanel and Button for individual buttons. Event-handling is used when buttons are clicked to pass props to the App component that contains the calculate method with logic of how to deal with the various components.
